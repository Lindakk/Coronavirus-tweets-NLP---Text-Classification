Sentiment Analysis of Coronavirus Tweets using BERT

Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on tweets related to the coronavirus pandemic using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) with TensorFlow. The dataset comprises tweets pulled from Twitter, which have been manually tagged for sentiment classification.

The objectives of this project are to:

Analyze Public Sentiment: Understand how people feel about the coronavirus pandemic based on their tweets.
Utilize Advanced NLP Techniques: Leverage BERT for accurate text classification, showcasing the effectiveness of transformer models in sentiment analysis.
Promote Data-Driven Insights: Provide insights that can help policymakers, health organizations, and researchers understand public perception during health crises.
Through this project, I aim to demonstrate the application of modern machine learning techniques in analyzing and interpreting social media data, contributing to a broader understanding of public sentiment in response to global events.
